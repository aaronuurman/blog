This post will show how to create a bootable Linux USB flash drive from the terminal and using just a `dd` command.
For it's required that you have downloaded an ISO of your choice, I'm going to use Fedora Workstation 32 ISO as an example.
In my case it is required to have a Linux machine (20GB disk) and at least 2GB USB flash drive.
Depending on distro it can be different.
I prefer this method because it's easy and I don't need to install any additional software for that.

## Create a bootable USB flash drive

1. Insert USB flash drive into the USB port.
2. Find the name of the USB drive. For that I found the easiest would be to use an `lsblk` command.
This will output something like that:

```bash
[aaron@dark-side ~]$ lsblk
NAME                            MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda                               8:0    1  14.6G  0 disk 
├─sda1                            8:1    1   1.9G  0 part /run/media/aaron/MediaUSB
├─sda2                            8:2    1    11M  0 part 
└─sda3                            8:3    1  22.9M  0 part 
nvme0n1                         259:0    0 232.9G  0 disk 
├─nvme0n1p1                     259:1    0   600M  0 part /boot/efi
├─nvme0n1p2                     259:2    0     1G  0 part /boot
└─nvme0n1p3                     259:3    0 231.3G  0 part 
  ├─fedora_localhost--live-root 253:0    0    70G  0 lvm  /
  ├─fedora_localhost--live-swap 253:1    0  11.8G  0 lvm  [SWAP]
  └─fedora_localhost--live-home 253:2    0 149.5G  0 lvm  /home
[aaron@dark-side ~]$ 

```

In that case USB flash drive is `dev/sda`, it can be different in your system.
In identifying the correct drive I usually check the size of the drive. This has been a good enough identifier.

3. Unmount USB flash drive.
For that I'm going to use `unmount` command.

```bash
sudo unmount /dev/sda1
```

4. Flash Linux ISO to a USB flash drive. 

```bash
sudo dd bs=4M if=/path/to/linux.iso of=/dev/sda status=progress oflag=sync
```

Make sure to use a correct device path and don't append partition number - In my case simply `/dev/sda` is enough.
Also, replace `/path/to/linux.iso` with a path to Linux ISO file in your system.

When this command finish successfully then everything is done.
Reboot the system and start installing :)
Depending on a system you may need to configure your BIOS to boot from USB.

## Summary
In this post I described a system of how I create a bootable Linux USB flash drive.
I have only tested this flow with some distros and it seemed to work in every case.
