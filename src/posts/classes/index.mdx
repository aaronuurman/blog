Classes also known as types are like building blocks of our application. Classes
combine related variables, functions (methods) and events together. A Class is
like a blueprint. It describes data and behavior of an object. So how to declare
a class? Here is three main components – access modifier, class keyword, and
identifier.
```csharp {numberLines: true}
public class Animal
{
  //Prop's goes here
}
```

In this code, is declared a publicly accessible class called Animal. The class
can be given private, protected, static and no access modifier – depends on our
need. When the class has been declared, we can add properties to that and
describe it’s behavior. So let’s say, the class will have field’s Name, Age, and
Weight and methods Walk(), Eat(), and Sleep().
```csharp {numberLines: true}
public class Animal
{
	public string Name;
	public int Age;
	public int Weight;

	public void Walk()
	{
		//Some code here
	}

	public void Eat()
	{
		//Some code here
	}

	public void Sleep()
	{
		//Some code here
	}
}
```

So now we see, that this class is like a blueprint for our object. They are not
same – class describes a type of object. To create the object we need to make
new variable and initialize it, this can be done with the following line.
```csharp
Animal Fox = new Animal();
```

To make this code shorter, object initialization can be written like so:
```csharp
var Fox = new Animal();
```

To access the object properties and methods dot notation can be used.
```csharp
Fox.Name = "Foxy";
```

For better demonstration, I’m going to create a new class called PlayWithAnimal
and inside this class, I’m going to create a method to give fox name.
```csharp {numberLines: true}
public class PlayWithAnimal
{
	private void GiveFoxName()
	{
		Animal Fox = new Animal();

		Fox.Name = "Foxy";
	}

}
```

In this code publicly accessible class has been created and it is called
PlayWithAnimal. Inside this class is private method GiveFoxName, and inside a
method is initialized Fox object and for the property, Name is given new value –
“Foxy”. In this post, I described how to declare a class with some properties
and methods, how to initialize an object and access object parameter with dot
notation. In next post, I’m going to take a closer look for access modifiers,
play with them and give some code examples.
