This post is about a small tip I discovered when I created a project with unit and integration tests.
In that project, I used some files to test a service functionality,
so I had to come up with a solution on how to share files between multiple projects.

## The need

This is a structure I'm trying to achieve in my current project.

<Modal>

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam DefaultTextAlignment center
skinparam WrapWidth 120
skinparam Shadowing false
skinparam BackgroundColor White
skinparam RectangleBorderThickness 0.5
skinparam ActivityBorderThickness 0.5
skinparam ActivityArrowFontSize 11
skinparam AgentBorderThickness 0.5
skinparam ArrowThickness 0.5
skinparam ArrowFontStyle Plain
skinparam NoteBorderThickness 0.5
skinparam ClassBorderThickness 0.5
left to right direction

folder "Project solution" {
  folder "UnitTests" {
    folder "Resources" as UnitResources {
      file "somefile.jpg" as unitfile1
      file "someotherfile.jpg" as unitfile2
    }
  }

  folder "IntregrationTests" {
    folder "Resources" as IntResources {
      file "somefile.jpg" as intfile1
      file "someotherfile.jpg" as intfile2
    }
  }

  folder "Shared" {
    folder "TestResources" as Resources {
      file "somefile.jpg" as file1
      file "someotherfile.jpg" as file2
    }
  }
}

Resources -UP-> UnitResources : linked
Resources --> IntResources : linked

```

</Modal>

## Solution

I ended up updating **.csproj** file directly by adding the following line.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Content Include="..\Shared\TestResources\**\*" Link="Resources\%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)" CopyToOutputDirectory="Always" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Here I'm using **Content** element to link files to project and publish them with the application.
All files in the shared folder are linked to the project **Resources** directory.

## Summary

File linking comes handy when there is a need to share content between multiple projects.
The result is much cleaner a well-structured project.
Also later when there is a need for file update then this can be done in a single place and all
linked content will also be updated.
