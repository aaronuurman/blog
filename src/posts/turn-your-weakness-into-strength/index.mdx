At the beginning of this year, we had kind of funny situation in a company where
I worked before. We were developing a portal and there needed to be done some
Javascript development. And somehow, we had managed to get all people into team
without good Javascript skill - even the front-end guy ðŸ˜‚<br /> So we had to
develop a Javascript app and we decided that I'm going to do this.

I must say, that at this point I didn't know much about Javascript.<br />
My skill was almost nothing - I knew how to import Jquery to project, write some selectors and do
console.log() for debugging.<br /> That was basically all my skill.<br /> I
think the reason why I was weak in Javascript is that I'm quite new in this
industry and mostly I worked as a back-end developer.

But yeah, when I got that project I knew that it's going to be really tough
times. In my personal development, I had this thinking that I wanna be a good
back-end developer. At this time I didn't want to waste my time on front-end
languages (at this point I didn't know, that Javascript is used even in the
back-end).

I feel that I was at the cross road on this point. I had to think do I finish
somehow this project and forget all about Javascript or do I really start
learning Javascript and get good at this.<br /> So I decided that I'm going to
learn Javascript and it wasn't easy. I worked and learned at the same
time.<br /> I spent all my free time watching videos about Javascript, reading
and writing code - on the train to work and to home, at work and after work at
home.

Could you imagine, you accept the project in a language you don't know almost
anything and you must get this project ready by the deadline. I had to be really
stupid or confident.<br /> But yea with 5 weeks I managed to ship this project
and it did the job that it supposed to do.<br /> Of course, there were no
tests.<br /> Of course, the structure wasn't right.<br /> Of course, there were
misuses of promises and callback, but it worked.<br /> When I think back on this
situation and someone asks me, do you wanna do this again and how much time it
would take you now?<br />

I would answer yes I wanna do this again and the time would be same.
Only this time I would ship better code with better architecture and with tests.

Now I'm still learning Javascript and will not stop learning and practice it. My
Javascript skill is pretty good now, I feel confident with this language and I
will use this in my future project.

So you may ask, Aaron what's the point of this story? This story got me thinking
about how I managed to take one of my weakness and turn it into one of my
strongest skills. I think anyone can do this if they just want to. It doesn't
have to be a programming language, think about anything. Think what is the one
thing that you could learn so that it would make your life easier and start
working on it.
