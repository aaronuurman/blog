In a previous post, I added an image option to blog command, did some refactoring and
added some unit tests. I this post I'm going to do some more refactoring, to come up with a better project structure, add additional tasks and try to get it all together so that I could start adding more commands. <br />
Probably this will be my last post about this tool, from now on I will extend it if I have some task that can be automated.

### Overview
The current version of assistant contains quite a lot of structural changes, I moved files from one place to another, refactored a lot of code and added additional tests, all for a better future.<br />
Blog command got a git task - now if I run the command it also creates a separate branch and makes an initial commit to it with starter file and image included. So that I can easily just jump into my Visual Studio and start writing a new blog post. This same post is also made using an assistant blog command, cool right?<br />
