# About Me

Hello everyone!

<div style={{ padding: '20px 0 30px 0'}}>

I'm Aaron Uurman, a software developer living and working in Estonia.

I got started in software development rather late,
after the second semester at university.
From that on I have never thought about doing something else,
I enjoy life as a developer. 
I have been a software developer on Microsoft stack for more than 4 years and I like it.
In my free time, I enjoy playing disc-golf, running or hiking.
