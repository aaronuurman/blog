Haven't blogged awhile now, but still trying to push on and get this into my
weekly routine. Meanwhile, I have changed company where I worked - joined with
startup Tebo. Right now trying to catch up what they have made those years when
I was not involved in this project.<br /> I'm not going to stop on this topic a
lot because I want to let you know about an awesome tool that colleague Erkki
introduced me, it's just amazing. Makes developer life lot easier, it's called
Vagrant. I have played around now for two weekends with it, even added to my
toolbox and use it right now, when I write this blog. But yeah, I try to give
breathe overview of it and hope you will find use of this tool too :)

## What is Vagrant?

Vagrant is a tool for building complete development environment, sandboxed in a
virtual machine. Vagrant lowers developer environment setup time.<br /> With one
command, it does all the following in minutes:<br />

-   Creates a virtual machine for you.

-   Modifies the physical properties of this virtual machine (e.g., RAM, number of
    CPUs, etc.).

-   Establishes network interfaces so that you can access your virtual machine
    from your own computer, another device on the same network, or even from
    another virtual machine.

-   Sets up shared folders so that you can continue editing files on your own
    machine and have those modifications mirror over to the guest machine.

-   Boots the virtual machine.

-   Sets the hostname of the machine.

-   Provisions software on the machine via a shell script or configuration
    management solution such as Chef, Puppet, or a custom solution.

-   Performs host and guest specific tweaking to work around known issues that may
    arise.

When it’s all done, you have completely sandboxed development environment.<br />
Due to the shared folder and networking, you can continue development using your
own editor and browser, but the code runs on a virtual machine, that vagrant has
set up for us.

### Requirements

Vagrant requires virtualization application, like VMWare or VirtualBox. Because
by default vagrant supports VirtualBox, I’m going to use that too.

### Vagrantfile

Vagrant is configured per project and each project has it’s own Vagrantfile. In
Vagrantfile is described OS, RAM, network settings and so on. This file can be
version controlled, so rest development team can stay sync with changes.

## Installation

### VirtualBox installation

I’m using Fedora 25, so I’m going to describe here how to get VirtualBox and
Vagrant installed on Fedora 25. If you are using another operation system,
please check out Vagrant website, they have really good documentation.<br />

Add VirtualBox repository and update system.

```bash
sudo su -
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
wget https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/rpm/fedora/virtualbox.repo
dnf update
```

Make sure you are running latest installed kernel version.

```bash
rpm -qa kernel |sort -V |tail -n 1
uname -r
```

If you got a kernel update, reboot system.

Install Virtualbox dependencies.

```bash {numberLines: true}
dnf install binutils gcc make patch libgomp glibc-headers \
	glibc-devel kernel-headers kernel-devel dkms
dnf install VirtualBox-5.1
```

Build needed kernel modules.

```bash
/usr/lib/virtualbox/vboxdrv.sh setup
```

In order to use VirtualBox, a user must be added to a vboxusers group. This
group was created automatically during VirtualBox installation process.

```bash
usermod -a -G vboxusers USERNAME
```

### Vagrant installation

```bash
sudo dnf install vagrant
```

Note that Fedora use libvirt as default provider, so to use Virtualbox instead
you need to set an environment variable for it.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y vagrant vagrant-libvirt libvirt-devel
```

### Project setup

First we gonna need project folder (create one or use existing). Navigate to the
folder in terminal.<br />

Create inital Vagrantfile.

```bash
vagrant init centos/7
```

To run Vagrant machine, run following command. This wil install and set up our
virtual machine with setting that is described in Vagrantfile.

```bash
vagrant up --provider virtualbox
```

By default Vagrant shares project folders with quest machine. For better
overview, I’m gonna create new folder under project folder and move my project
files there. In Vagrantfile I define new shared folder.

```bash
config.vm.synced_folder "./game", "/server/website"
```

Now, before rebooting virtual machine, if you are using VirtualBox we need to
install Vagrant plugin to make folder sharing possable between guest virtual
machine and host machine.

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

When installation is completed, we need to reboot virtual machine.

```bash
vagrant reload
```

To access my project thought webbrowser we gonna need to forward ports and set
up simple server.

```bash
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
```

Reboot guest.

```bash
vagrant reload
```

Now ssh to guest machine and navigate to /vagrant folder.

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

Now we need to set up python http server.

```bash
sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```

For now, we have vagrant machine up. Inside that we are running server where is
hosted my tetris game (not ready yet). If I navigate to
https://localhost:8080/game/, I see my tetris game.

## Useful commands

```bash {numberLines: true}
#SSH to machine.
vagrant ssh

#Check running vagrant machines.
vagrant status

#Destroy vagrant machine (files in shared folders are not destroyed).
vagrant destroy

#Shut down virtual machine.
vagrant halt
```
